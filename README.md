# windows-terminal-icons

[Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) is great, but when building profiles it lacks descriptive default icons for profiles. This repo hopes to solve this issue. Spend your time configuring a new profile; [not searching for an icon](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/1918).

## Terminal Profile Icon Size

In the [Windows Terminal docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/customize-settings/profile-appearance#icons), Microsoft specifies icon size accordingly:

> Icons should be sized to 32x32px in an appropriate raster image format (e.g. .PNG, .GIF, or .ICO) to avoid having to scale your icons during runtime (causing a noticeable delay and loss of quality).

All icons in this set are `.png` files with alpha, sized accordingly, and compressed for lightest file size while preserving quality.

## Contributions

*If you have an icon in mind, contributions and pull requests are welcome. You can also open an issue to make a suggestion or improvement for the current icon set.*
